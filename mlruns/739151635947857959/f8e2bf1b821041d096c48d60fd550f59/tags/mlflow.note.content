Final version of the basic WR model. I feel good about this model, I don't think its overfit, it is getting good test error metrics and the correlation plot is quite accurate. 
Biggest points are that the data includes college seasons at lower levels (my gm toolbox does not), I didn't include production score, and the monotonic constraints are correct.
I also filtered out guys who didn't play in the league and am using the bigger train sample with the scaled values for early career and sample weights.
